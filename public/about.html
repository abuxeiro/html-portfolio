<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in Switzerland in 1980 to a Spanish family.</p>
<p>I'm a musician and a software developer.</p>
<p>I have been involved in music since a young age. 
I initially pursued a career in computer science and worked professionally in the field for a few years. 
However, my passion for music led me to take a hiatus and focus on it for the next 17 years. 
Now, I am returning to the field of software engineering.</p>
